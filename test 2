Visualise this, I'm doing a project where i need to calculate the reserve factor for belly fairing panels of aircraft where a possible damage has happened.
i have a home.html page where there's a picture showing the drawing of whole bellyfairing divided in 5 zones, we need to select the damage occuring zone, then we move on to zone.html let's say we have damage in zone 1, so this page shows the panels in zone 1, then we click on our panel which has damage, then panel.html opens, which has that panels divided into different areas, let's say we selected panel 106, this then redirects to area.html where the panel 106 is divided into let's say 3 areas 1,2,3 and we have damage in area 2, we select area 2 and we head to area.html, which has alll the area details and a calculate button, when we click calculate it redirects us to a rf.html where we can type in our damage details and we get rf values.
now i have prepared the basic layouts of all html pages. I need to ask for msn of aircraft in the first home page. so if my damage was in msn 438, zone 1, panel 106, area 2, this data will get carry forward to the rf.html so that calculation will be easy.
note : there might be different configurations of panels let say for msn 438 panel 207 doesn't exits instead it's been divided into 207A and 207B so i need to ask the user which one he wants, and there might be more choices like this, so for this we can create separate .js files froom which we can fetch data dynamically and proceed. how does this look
